# ValKey is a Redis-compatible server running in Docker on port 6379. 
# It stores data as key-value pairs, which allows Python programs to save and retrieve information quickly. 
# The 'redis' Python library connects to ValKey just like it would to a normal Redis server, letting us perform operations like set/get keys. 
# RQ (Redis Queue) uses this same Redis/ValKey backend to manage background tasks asynchronously, which is especially useful for AI workflows, like training models or processing data without blocking the main program. 
# In short, ValKey provides the storage, redis library handles communication, and RQ manages queued tasks — together forming a fast, async AI development setup.
